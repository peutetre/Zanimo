sauce-tunnel
============

A Node.js wrapper around the Saucelabs tunnel jar. 

This code is extracted from [grunt-saucelabs](https://github.com/axemclion/grunt-saucelabs) by [axemclion](https://github.com/axemclion), with the grunt-specific parts removed. 

It was extracted into its own module to avoid duplication between grunt-saucelabs, [grunt-mocha-webdriver](https://github.com/grunt-mocha-webdriver), and any future Node module that may need it.
